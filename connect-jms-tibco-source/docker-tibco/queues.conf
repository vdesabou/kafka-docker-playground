# This file defines all queues
#
# The format:
#
# <queue-name> [<property1,property2,...>]
#
# where properties are:
#
#  store=<store-name>     - use named file when saving messages for queue
#  secure                 - use permission verification
#  maxbytes=<size>        - maximum number of bytes of all outstanding
#                           messages for this queue, 0 means no limit
#  maxmsgs=<count>        - maximum number of messages for this queue,
#                           0 means no limit
#  overflowPolicy=<a>     - action on exceeding limit where <a> can be
#                           default, discardOld or rejectIncoming
#  maxRedelivery=<count>  - maximum number of times this message can be
#                           delivered to receivers.
#  expiration=<time>      - override expiration specifed by producer
#                           where <time> is in seconds, 0 means no expiry
#  flowControl=<size>     - set flow control threshold size
#  prefetch=<value>       - prefetch count, default is 5.
#                           "none" specifies no prefetch mode which causes
#                           messages to be sent to receives only upon request.
#  exclusive              - each message sent to this queue is received
#                           by the same queue receiver until it shuts
#                           down and another receiver is chosen
#  global                 - messages sent to this queue can be routed
#  import=<list>          - list of import transports
#  trace[=body]           - trace messages on this destination
#  sender_name            - add producer's name to msg (if not disabled)
#  sender_name_enforced   - always add producer's name to msg
#  redeliveryDelay=<time> - delay redelivery for specified number of seconds
#
# Properties on the queue are inherited by all static
# and dynamic queues with matching names. There are two
# wildcard characters, '*' and '>'. '*' matches any one
# part of a queue name (parts are delimited by the '.'
# character). '>' matches all parts of the queue name
# after the '>'. The queue name ">" matches all queues.
#
# Examples:
# If queue "test.*" is set to secure, it implies queues
# "test.1" and "test.ems" are secure.
#
# If queue "test.>" is set to global, it implies queues
# "test.1" and "test.ems.sample" are global.
#
# Only queues listed in this file and queues with matching names can be
# created by the applications (unless otherwise permitted by acl.conf).
#
# Examples:
#
# test               store=$sys.failsafe,secure,prefetch=2
# business.inventory prefetch=1,maxbytes=1MB
# supermarket        exclusive,import=RV
