            * Control Flow Tracing: By dynamically instrumenting Java code, the tool meticulously tracks the precise sequence of executed methods at runtime. This capability offers invaluable insights into how an application navigates its logic. The tool provides a way to generate a stack trace when a method is called. 
            * Additional Logging: This enhanced logging capability provides a way to print the input arguments to a method and return value from a method. 
            * Delve into heap area: Generating heap dump at a method call will be crucial to analyze the state of JVM at a given point. The tool has capabilities to generate thread dump as well to track the state of all the threads when a method is called.

            * You can also generate json data using json or sql format using syntax from https://github.com/MaterializeInc/datagen
            
            * You can also generate json data using syntax from https://github.com/vdesabou/avro-random-generator (same as datagen source connector)
            
            * Use completion to select predefined schemas (or use your own schema file) 🎓 Tip: use <tab> completion to trigger fzf completion
            
            * Directly set payload ("%g" can be used to generate a counter)

            If the key contain a number, it will be used as starting point and incremented for each record. 
            
            Example: key1 will start with key1, then key2, etc..
            Example: mykey-10-suffix will start with mykey-10-suffix then mykey-11-suffix, etc..

            Example: key%g will start with key1, then key2, etc..
            
            Otherwise, the key will be same for all records.
