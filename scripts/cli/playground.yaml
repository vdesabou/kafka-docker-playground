        ⛅ When running Confluent Cloud (ccloud) example:
        
          All you have to do is to be already logged in with confluent CLI.
        
          By default, a new Confluent Cloud environment with a Cluster will be created.
        
          You can configure the new cluster by setting:
        
          --cluster-type (or CLUSTER_TYPE environment variable): The type of cluster (possible values: basic, standard and dedicated, default basic)
          --cluster-cloud (or CLUSTER_CLOUD environment variable): The Cloud provider (possible values: aws, gcp and azure, default aws)
          --cluster-region (or CLUSTER_REGION environment variable): The Cloud region (use confluent kafka region list to get the list, default eu-west-2 for aws, westeurope for azure and europe-west2 for gcp)
          --cluster-environment (or ENVIRONMENT environment variable) (optional): The environment id where want your new cluster (example: txxxxx) 
        
          In case you want to use your own existing cluster, you need to setup, in addition to previous ones:
        
          --cluster-name (or CLUSTER_NAME environment variable): The cluster name
          --cluster-creds (or CLUSTER_CREDS environment variable): The Kafka api key and secret to use, it should be separated with colon (example: <API_KEY>:<API_KEY_SECRET>)
          --cluster-schema-registry-creds (or SCHEMA_REGISTRY_CREDS environment variable) (optional, if not set, new one will be created): The Schema Registry api key and secret to use, it should be separated with colon (example: <SR_API_KEY>:<SR_API_KEY_SECRET>)

            🤎 Java producer type to use
            
            One of avro, avro-with-key, protobuf, protobuf-with-key, json-schema, json-schema-with-key
            
            🎓 Tip: Most of times, it's much simpler to use 'playground topic produce'. Use java producer only if you have very specific requirements such as specifying record timestamp or to do perf testing (even though CLI is also good for that)
            
            🎓 Tip: 'with-key' will also produce key with selected converter, otherwise LongConverter is used
            
            Default value: none
            
            Allowed values: none, avro, avro-with-key, protobuf, protobuf-with-key, json-schema, json-schema-with-key

            🔥 You can either:
            
            * Set your own schema (avro, json-schema, protobuf) within single quotes (see examples)

            * Use completion to select predefined schemas (or use your own schema file) 🎓 Tip: use <tab> completion to trigger fzf completion
            
            * Directly set payload ("%g" can be used to generate a counter)
            
            In case of 'raw' data (i.e not using schema):
            
            If the key contain a number, it will be used as starting point and incremented for each record. 
            
            Example: key1 will start with key1, then key2, etc..
            Example: mykey-10-suffix will start with mykey-10-suffix then mykey-11-suffix, etc..
            
            "%g" can also be used to generate a counter
            
            Example: key%g will start with key1, then key2, etc..
            
            Otherwise, the key will be same for all records.
