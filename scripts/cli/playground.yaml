            🔥 You can either:
            
            * Set your own schema (avro, json-schema, protobuf) with stdin (see example section). 
            
            * You can also generate json data using json or sql format using syntax from https://github.com/MaterializeInc/datagen
            
            * Use completion to select predefined schemas (or use your own schema file) 🎓 Tip: use <tab> completion to trigger fzf completion
            
            * Directly set payload ("%g" can be used to generate a counter)
