The tool provides a way to generate a stack trace when a method is called. \n  * Additional Logging: This enhanced logging capability provides a way to print the input arguments to a method and return value from a method. \n  * Delve into heap area: Generating heap dump at a method call will be crucial to analyze the state of JVM at a given point.
