	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
Schema Config
==========================
🔘 schema.context.name

Add a schema context name. A schema context represents an independent scope in Schema Registry. It is a separate sub-schema tied to topics in different Kafka clusters that share the same Schema Registry instance. If not used, the connector uses the default schema configured for Schema Registry in your Confluent Cloud environment.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: default
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

==========================
How should we connect to your database?
==========================

The logical name is also used for the namespaces of the corresponding Avro schema, if Avro data format is used. Kafka topics must (and will be) created with the prefix ``database.server.name``. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens and dots are allowed.
	 - Required: HIGH

🔘 database.ssl.mode

What SSL mode should we use to connect to your database. The default `preferred` option establishes an encrypted connection if the server supports secure connections. If the server does not support secure connections, it falls back to an unencrypted connection. The `required` option establishes an encrypted connection or fails if one cannot be made for any reason.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: preferred
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: true

==========================
Database details
==========================
🔘 signal.data.collection



	 - Type: false

	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 database.include.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional comma-separated list of strings that match database names to be monitored. Any database name not included in the list is excluded from monitoring. By default all databases are monitored. May not be used with database.exclude.list.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 database.exclude.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional comma-separated list of strings that match database names to be excluded from monitoring. Any database name not included in the list is monitored. May not be used with database.include.list.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 database.connectionTimeZone



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: The value must be a valid ZoneId.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 table.include.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional comma-separated list of strings that match fully-qualified table identifiers for tables to be monitored. Any table not included in this config property is excluded from monitoring. Each identifier is in the form ``schemaName.tableName``. By default the connector monitors every non-system table in each monitored schema. May not be used with "Table excluded".
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 table.exclude.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional comma-separated list of strings that match fully-qualified table identifiers for tables to be excluded from monitoring. Any table not included in this config property is monitored. Each identifier is in the form ``schemaName.tableName``. May not be used with "Table included".
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 datatype.propagate.source.type



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: A comma-separated list of regular expressions matching the database-specific data type names that adds the data type's original type and original length as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 snapshot.mode

Specifies the criteria for running a snapshot when the connector starts. The default setting is `initial` and specifies that the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets have been recorded for the logical server name. The `when_needed` option specifies that the connector run a snapshot upon startup whenever necessary; typically when no offsets are available, or when a previously recorded offset specifies a binlog location or GTID that is not available in the server. The `never` option specifies that the connect should never use snapshots and that when the connector starts with a logical server name, the connector should read from the beginning of the binlog. Use the `never` option with care, as it is only valid when the binlog is guaranteed to contain the entire history of the database. The `schema_only` option performs a snapshot of the schemas and not the data. This setting is useful when you do not need the topics to contain a consistent snapshot of the data but need them to have only the changes since the connector was started. The `schema_only_recovery` option  is a recovery setting for a connector that has already been capturing changes. When you restart the connector, this setting enables recovery of a corrupted or lost database history topic. You might set it periodically to "clean up" a database history topic that has been growing unexpectedly. Database history topics require infinite retention.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: initial
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 snapshot.locking.mode

Controls how long the connector holds onto the global read lock while it is performing a snapshot. The default is `minimal`, which means the connector holds the global read lock (and thus prevents any updates) for just the initial portion of the snapshot, while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table. This is accomplished using a REPEATABLE READ transaction, even when the lock is no longer held and other operations are updating the database. However, in some cases it may be desirable to block all writes for the entire duration of the snapshot. In this situation, set this property to `extended`. Using a value of `none` prevents the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot process. While this setting is allowed with all snapshot modes, it is safe to use if and only if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is running.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: minimal
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 tombstones.on.delete

Controls whether a tombstone event should be generated after a delete event. When set to ``true``, the delete operations are represented by a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event. When set to ``false``, only a delete event is sent. Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key, once the source record got deleted.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: true
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

Controls how frequently the connector sends heartbeat messages to a Kafka topic. The behavior of default value 0 is that the connector does not send heartbeat messages.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 0
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 database.history.skip.unparseable.ddl

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 event.deserialization.failure.handling.mode

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 decimal.handling.mode

Specifies how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns should be represented in change events, including: 'precise' (the default) uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'string' uses string to represent values; 'double' represents values using Java's 'double', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: precise
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 binary.handling.mode

Specifies how binary (blob, binary, etc.) columns should be represented in change events, including: 'bytes' (the default) represents binary data as byte array; 'base64' represents binary data as base64-encoded string; 'hex' represents binary data as hex-encoded (base16) string.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: bytes
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 time.precision.mode

Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including: 'adaptive_time_microseconds' TIME fields always use microseconds precision; 'connect' (the default) always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: connect
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 cleanup.policy

Set the topic cleanup policy

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: delete

	 - Required: false
