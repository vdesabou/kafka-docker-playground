	 - Required: false

==========================
How should we name your topic(s)?
==========================
🔘 topic.prefix



	 - Type: true
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Topic prefix that provides a namespace (logical server name) for the particular PostgreSQL database server or cluster in which Debezium is capturing changes. The prefix should be unique across all other connectors, since it is used as a topic name prefix for all Kafka topics that receive records from this connector. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots and underscores must be used. The connector automatically creates Kafka topics using the naming convention: `<topic.prefix>.<schemaName>.<tableName>`.
	 - Required: HIGH

==========================
Database config
==========================
🔘 slot.name

The name of the PostgreSQL logical decoding slot that was created for streaming changes from a particular plug-in for a particular database/schema. The server uses this slot to stream events to the Debezium connector that you are configuring. Slot names must conform to PostgreSQL replication slot naming rules, which state: "Each replication slot has a name, which can contain lower-case letters, numbers, and the underscore character."

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: debezium
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 publication.name

The name of the PostgreSQL publication created for streaming changes when using `pgoutput`. Based on the value of ``publication.autocreate.mode`` the publication is created at start-up if it does not already exist and it includes all tables. Debezium then applies its own include/exclude list filtering, if configured, to limit the publication to change events for the specific tables of interest. The connector user must have superuser permissions to create this publication, so it is usually preferable to create the publication before starting the connector for the first time. If the publication already exists, either for all tables or configured with a subset of tables, Debezium uses the publication as it is defined.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: dbz_publication
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 publication.autocreate.mode

Applies only when streaming changes by using the pgoutput plug-in. Possible settings are `all_tables`, `disabled`, and `filtered`. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: all_tables
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 publish.via.partition.root

This configuration is applicable only when the connector is responsible for creating the publication in the source database. It determines how change events from partitioned tables are captured and emitted.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 signal.data.collection



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Fully-qualified name of the data collection that needs to be used to send signals to the connector. Use ``schemaName.tableName`` format to specify the fully-qualified collection name. Note that the connector automatically adds the signal table to the publication only if the ``publication.autocreate.mode`` is set to ``filtered`` or ``all_tables``. You will need to add it manually if the mode is set to ``disabled``.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 slot.failover

Specifies whether the connector creates a failover slot. If set to false (the default), or if the primary server runs PostgreSQL 16 or earlier, the connector does not create a failover slot.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

==========================
Connector config
==========================
🔘 snapshot.mode

Specifies the criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Possible settings are: `initial`, `never`(deprecated), `no_data`, `initial_only`, and `when_needed`. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: initial
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 table.include.list

To match the name of a table, Debezium applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire identifier for the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name. 

	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers for tables whose changes you want to capture. When this property is set, the connector captures changes only from the specified tables. Each identifier is of the form `schemaName.tableName`. By default, the connector captures changes in every non-system table in each schema whose changes are being captured. 
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 table.exclude.list

To match the name of a table, Debezium applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire identifier for the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name. 

	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers for tables whose changes you do not want to capture. Each identifier is of the form `schemaName.tableName`. When this property is set, the connector captures changes from every table that you do not specify. 
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 event.processing.failure.handling.mode

Specifies how the connector should react to exceptions during processing of events. Possible settings are: `fail`, `skip`, and `warn`. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: fail
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 column.exclude.list

To match the name of a column, Debezium applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire name string of the column; it does not match substrings that might be present in a column name.

	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns to exclude from change event record values. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form `schemaName.tableName.columnName`. 
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 schema.name.adjustment.mode

Specifies how schema names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. Possible settings are: `none`, `avro`, and `avro_unicode`. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: none
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 field.name.adjustment.mode

Specifies how field names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. Possible settings are: `none`, `avro`, and `avro_unicode`. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: none
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 heartbeat.interval.ms

Controls how frequently the connector sends heartbeat messages to a Kafka topic. The behavior of default value 0 is that the connector does not send heartbeat messages. Heartbeat messages are useful for monitoring whether the connector is receiving change events from the database. Heartbeat messages might help decrease the number of change events that need to be re-sent when a connector restarts. To send heartbeat messages, set this property to a positive integer, which indicates the number of milliseconds between heartbeat messages.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 0
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 heartbeat.action.query

This configuration helps address situations where capturing changes from a low-traffic database on the same host as a high-traffic one prevents Debezium from processing WAL records and acknowledging WAL positions with the database. To address this, create a heartbeat table in the low-traffic database, and set this property to a DML statement that periodically updates the table by either inserting a new row or repeatedly updating the same row. This allows the connector to receive changes from the low-traffic database and acknowledge their LSNs, preventing unbounded WAL growth on the database host. The heartbeat query executes at regular intervals, as specified by the ``heartbeat.interval.ms`` configuration property. 

	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: If specified, the connector executes this query on every heartbeat against the source database. The query must be a valid SQL DML statement, typically an ``INSERT`` or ``UPDATE``, that targets a dedicated heartbeat table. 
	 - Required: LOW

==========================
Schema Config
==========================
🔘 schema.context.name

Add a schema context name. A schema context represents an independent scope in Schema Registry. It is a separate sub-schema tied to topics in different Kafka clusters that share the same Schema Registry instance. If not used, the connector uses the default schema configured for Schema Registry in your Confluent Cloud environment.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: default
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 key.converter.reference.subject.name.strategy

Set the subject reference name strategy for key. Valid entries are `DefaultReferenceSubjectNameStrategy` or `QualifiedReferenceSubjectNameStrategy`. Note that the subject reference name strategy can be selected only for `PROTOBUF` format with the default strategy being `DefaultReferenceSubjectNameStrategy`.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: DefaultReferenceSubjectNameStrategy
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

==========================
How should we handle data types?
==========================
🔘 decimal.handling.mode

Specifies how the connector should handle values for `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC` columns. Possible settings are: `precise`, `double`, and `string`. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: precise
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 time.precision.mode

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 errors.tolerance

Use this property if you would like to configure the connector's error handling behavior. WARNING: This property should be used with CAUTION for SOURCE CONNECTORS as it may lead to dataloss. If you set this property to 'all', the connector will not fail on errant records, but will instead log them (and send to DLQ for Sink Connectors) and continue processing. If you set this property to 'none', the connector task will fail on errant records.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: none
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 value.converter.ignore.default.for.nullables

When set to true, this property ensures that the corresponding record in Kafka is NULL, instead of showing the default column value. Applicable for AVRO,PROTOBUF and JSON_SR Converters.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
