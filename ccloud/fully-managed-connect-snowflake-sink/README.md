# Fully Managed  Snowflake Sink connector

## Objective

Quickly test [Snowflake Sink](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-snowflake-sink.html#) connector.

## Register a trial account

Go to [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) and register an account. You'll receive an email to setup your account and access to a 30 day trial instance.

To get the `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME`, go there and click on url:

This will give you an url like:

```
https://<SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.snowflakecomputing.com
```

Example:

```
https://of77992.eu-west-2.aws.snowflakecomputing.com
```

`SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME` should be set with `of77992.eu-west-2.aws`

## Prerequisites

All you have to do is to be already logged in with [confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html#confluent-cli-overview).

By default, a new Confluent Cloud environment with a Cluster will be created.

You can configure the cluster by setting environment variables:

* `CLUSTER_CLOUD`: The Cloud provider (possible values: `aws`, `gcp` and `azure`, default `aws`)
* `CLUSTER_REGION`: The Cloud region (use `confluent kafka region list` to get the list, default `eu-west-2`)
* `CLUSTER_TYPE`: The type of cluster (possible values: `basic`, `standard` and `dedicated`, default `basic`)
* `ENVIRONMENT` (optional): The environment id where want your new cluster (example: `txxxxx`) 

In case you want to use your own existing cluster, you need to setup these environment variables:

* `ENVIRONMENT`: The environment id where your cluster is located (example: `txxxxx`) 
* `CLUSTER_NAME`: The cluster name
* `CLUSTER_CLOUD`: The Cloud provider (possible values: `aws`, `gcp` and `azure`)
* `CLUSTER_REGION`: The Cloud region (example `us-east-2`)
* `CLUSTER_CREDS`: The Kafka api key and secret to use, it should be separated with colon (example: `<API_KEY>:<API_KEY_SECRET>`)
* `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_CREDS` (optional, if not set, new one will be created): The Schema Registry api key and secret to use, it should be separated with colon (example: `<SR_API_KEY>:<SR_API_KEY_SECRET>`)

## How to run

Simply run:

```bash
$ playground run -f fully-managed-snowflake-sink<use tab key to activate fzf completion (see https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/cli?id=%e2%9a%a1-setup-completion), otherwise use full path, or correct relative path> <SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME> <SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME> <SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD>
```

Note: you can also export these values as environment variable
