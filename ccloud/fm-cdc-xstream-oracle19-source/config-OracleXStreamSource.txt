==========================
Output messages
==========================
🔘 output.key.format

Sets the output Kafka record key format. Valid entries are AVRO, JSON_SR, or PROTOBUF. Note that you need to have Confluent Cloud Schema Registry configured when using a schema-based message format like AVRO, JSON_SR, and PROTOBUF.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: AVRO
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 output.data.format

Sets the output Kafka record value format. Valid entries are AVRO, JSON_SR, or PROTOBUF. Note that you need to have Confluent Cloud Schema Registry configured when using a schema-based message format like AVRO, JSON_SR, and PROTOBUF.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: AVRO
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: true

==========================
How should we name your topic(s)?
==========================
🔘 topic.prefix

Warning: Do not change the value of this property. If you change the value, after a restart, instead of continuing to emit events to the original topics, the connector emits subsequent events to topics whose names are based on the new value. The connector is also unable to recover its database schema history topic.

	 - Type: true
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Topic prefix that provides a namespace for the Oracle database server or cluster from which the connector captures changes. The topic prefix should be unique across all other connectors, since it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events from this connector. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots and underscores are accepted. 
	 - Required: HIGH

==========================
Connector configuration
==========================
🔘 table.include.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers for the tables whose changes you want to capture. When this property is set, the connector will only capture changes from the specified tables. Each identifier is of the form `schemaName.tableName`. By default, the connector captures changes from all non-system tables in each captured database. To match the name of a table, the connector applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire identifier for the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name. If you include this property in the configuration, do not set the ``table.exclude.list`` property.
	 - Required: HIGH

🔘 table.exclude.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified table identifiers for the tables whose changes you do not want to capture. When this property is set, the connector captures changes from any table that is not specified in the exclude list. Each identifier is of the form `schemaName.tableName`. To match the name of a table, the connector applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire identifier for the table; it does not match substrings that might be present in a table name. If you include this property in the configuration, do not set the ``table.include.list`` property.
	 - Required: HIGH

🔘 snapshot.mode

The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Select one of the following snapshot options: 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: initial
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 schema.history.internal.skip.unparseable.ddl

A boolean value that specifies whether the connector should ignore a DDL statement that cannot be parsed or stop processing for a human to address the issue. The safe default is `false` which causes the connector to fail when it encounters an unparseable DDL statement. Setting the value to `true` should be done with care as it will cause the connector to skip processing any DDL statement it cannot parse, and this could potentially lead to schema mismatches and data loss.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 snapshot.database.errors.max.retries

Specifies the number of retry attempts the connector will make to snapshot a table if a database error occurs. This configuration property currently only retries failures related to ORA-01466 error. By default, no retries are attempted.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 0
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 tombstones.on.delete

Controls whether a delete event is followed by a tombstone event. The following values are possible: 

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: true
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 skipped.operations

A comma-separated list of operations to skip during streaming. You can configure the connector to skip the following types of operations: c (inserts/create), u (updates), d (deletes), t (truncates), and none to indicate nothing is skipped. The default value is t, ensuring that only truncate operations are skipped.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: t
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 schema.name.adjustment.mode

Specifies how schema names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. The following values are possible:  

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: none
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 field.name.adjustment.mode

Specifies how field names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. The following values are possible: 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: none
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 heartbeat.interval.ms

Controls how often the connector sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. It is useful in situations when no changes occur in the captured tables for an extended period. In such cases, there are no change event messages generated, causing the committed source offset to remain unchanged. As a result, the connector is unable to update the processed low watermark on the outbound server which could result in the database retaining archived redo log files longer than needed. The default value is 0 which disables the heartbeat mechanism.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 0
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 database.os.timezone

Specifies the database server's operating system timezone. This is used to read the time when the LCR was generated at the source database. The default timezone is UTC. The value has to be a valid `java.time.ZoneId` identifier.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: UTC
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 column.include.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified column identifiers to be included in change event values. Each identifier is of the form `schemaName.tableName.columnName`. To match the name of a column, the connector applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire identifier for the column; it does not match substrings that might be present in a column name. If you include this property in the configuration, do not set the `column.exclude.list` property. Note: Primary key columns are always included in an event's key, even if you do not use this property to explicitly include its value.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 column.exclude.list



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified column identifiers to be excluded from change event values. Each identifier is of the form `schemaName.tableName.columnName`. To match the name of a column, the connector applies the regular expression that you specify as an anchored regular expression. That is, the specified expression is matched against the entire identifier for the column; it does not match substrings that might be present in a column name. If you include this property in the configuration, do not set the `column.include.list` property. Note: Primary key columns are always included in an event's key, even if you use this property to explicitly exclude its value.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 unavailable.value.placeholder

Specifies the constant provided by the connector to indicate that the original value was unavailable and not provided by the database.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: __cflt_unavailable_value
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 lob.oversize.threshold

Specifies the maximum size threshold (in bytes) for large object (LOB) column values, including CLOB, NCLOB, and BLOB. For CLOB and NCLOB values, the connector calculates the size as the UTF-8 encoded byte length of the string. If a LOB value exceeds this threshold, the connector handles it according to the strategy specified using the ``lob.oversize.handling.mode`` configuration. The default value is -1, which disables oversize handling.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: -1
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 lob.oversize.handling.mode

Defines how the connector handles large object (LOB) column values that exceed the size threshold specified using the ``lob.oversize.threshold`` configuration. Select one of the following options: 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: fail
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 skip.value.placeholder

Specifies the constant provided by the connector to indicate that the original value was skipped by the connector due to exceeding the configured size threshold.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: __cflt_skipped_value
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 signal.data.collection

The case of object names in the fully-qualified name must match exactly how they are stored in the Oracle database. Unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive and are treated as uppercase by default, whereas quoted identifiers are case-sensitive. 

	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Specifies the fully qualified name of the signaling table in the format: `databaseName.schemaName.tableName`.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 errors.tolerance

Use this property if you would like to configure the connector's error handling behavior. WARNING: This property should be used with CAUTION for SOURCE CONNECTORS as it may lead to dataloss. If you set this property to 'all', the connector will not fail on errant records, but will instead log them (and send to DLQ for Sink Connectors) and continue processing. If you set this property to 'none', the connector task will fail on errant records.
