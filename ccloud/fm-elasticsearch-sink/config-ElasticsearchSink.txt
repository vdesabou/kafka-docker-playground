==========================
Data Conversion
==========================
🔘 key.ignore

Whether to ignore the record key for the purpose of forming the Elasticsearch document ID. When this is set to true, document IDs will be generated as topic+partition+offset taken from the record. When this is set to false, the record key will be used as the Elasticsearch document ID.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 topic.key.ignore



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: List of topics for which ``key.ignore`` should be ``true``.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 schema.ignore

Whether to ignore schemas during indexing. When this is set to true, the record schema will be ignored for the purpose of registering an Elasticsearch mapping. Elasticsearch will infer the mapping from the data (dynamic mapping needs to be enabled by the user).

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 topic.schema.ignore



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: List of topics for which ``schema.ignore`` should be ``true``.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 compact.map.entries

Defines how map entries with string keys within record values should be written to JSON. When this is set to true, these entries are written compactly as "entryKey": "entryValue". Otherwise, map entries with string keys are written as a nested document {"key": "entryKey", "value": "entryValue"}.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: true
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 write.method

Method used for writing data to Elasticsearch, and one of INSERT or UPSERT. The default method is INSERT, in which the connector constructs a document from the record value and inserts that document into Elasticsearch, completely replacing any existing document with the same ID; this matches previous behavior. The UPSERT method will create a new document if one with the specified ID does not yet exist, or will update an existing document with the same ID by adding/replacing only those fields present in the record value. The UPSERT method may require additional time and resources of Elasticsearch, so consider increasing the read.timeout.ms and decreasing the batch.size configuration properties.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: INSERT
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 external.version.header



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Header name to pull value for external versioning, defaults to using the kafka record offset. Must have a numeric value.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 use.autogenerated.ids

Specifies whether to use auto-generated Elasticsearch document IDs for insertion requests. Note that this setting removes exactly once guarantees, and message delivery will be at least once. This only applies if the write method is set to `INSERT`. When set to `true`, the `Ignore Key mode` option will also be ignored when sending data to Elasticsearch.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
Connection Details
==========================
🔘 batch.size

The number of records to process as a batch when writing to Elasticsearch.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 2000
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 linger.ms

Linger time in milliseconds for batching. Records that arrive in between request transmissions are batched into a single bulk indexing request, based on the batch.size configuration. Normally this only occurs under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However, it may be desirable to reduce the number of requests even under light load and benefit from bulk indexing. This setting helps accomplish that - when a pending batch is not full, rather than immediately sending it out the task will wait up to the given delay to allow other records to be added so that they can be batched into a single request.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 1000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 flush.timeout.ms

The timeout in milliseconds to use for periodic flushing, and when waiting for buffer space to be made available by completed requests as records are added. If this timeout is exceeded the task will fail.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 10000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 connection.compression

Whether to use GZip compression on HTTP connection to ElasticSearch. To make this setting to work the http.compression setting also needs to be enabled at the Elasticsearch nodes before using it.

	 - Type: STRING

	 - Type: LONG
	 - Default: 300000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 max.poll.records

The maximum number of records to consume from Kafka in a single request. This configuration property may be used to improve the performance of the connector, if the connector cannot send records to the sink system. Defaults to 500 records.

The type of external resource the connector writes to, such as indices, datastreams or aliases. Valid options are INDEX, DATASTREAM, ALIAS_INDEX, ALIAS_DATASTREAM, and DISABLED. When set to DISABLED, the connector will auto-create indices or datastreams based on the topic name and datastream configurations.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: DISABLED
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 topic.to.external.resource.mapping



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: A list of topic-to-resource mappings in the format 'topic:resource'. If specified, the connector will use the provided resource name (index, data stream, or alias) instead of the topic name for writing to Elasticsearch. The resource must exist in Elasticsearch before configuring the connector. The type of resource (index, data stream, or alias) is determined by the 'external.resource.usage' configuration.
	 - Required: HIGH

==========================
Data Streams
==========================
🔘 data.stream.type

Describes the generic type of data to be written to a data stream. The default value is `none`, indicating that the connector will write to regular indices. If set, this configuration will be used alongside data.stream.dataset to construct the data stream name in the form of {``data.stream.type``}-{``data.stream.dataset``}-{``data.stream.namespace``}. Possible values are `logs`, `metrics`, `none`, and custom index templates defined in the destination cluster are also supported.

	 - Type: STRING

	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 data.stream.dataset



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Describes the data ingested and its structure to be written to a data stream. This can be any arbitrary string, provided it is no longer than 100 characters, in all lowercase, and does not contain spaces or any special characters ``/\*"<>|,#:-``. If no value is set, the connector writes to regular indices. If set, this configuration will be used alongside data.stream.type to construct the data stream name in the form of {``data.stream.type``}-{``data.stream.dataset``}-{``data.stream.namespace``}.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 data.stream.namespace

Generic name describing a user-configurable arbitrary grouping for writing to a data stream. It can be any string up to 100 characters, in lowercase, without spaces or special characters (`/\*"<>|,#:-`). If unset, the connector writes to regular indices. When set, it is used with `data.stream.type` and `data.stream.dataset` to form the data stream name in the format `{data.stream.type}-{data.stream.dataset}-{data.stream.namespace}`. Default is `${topic}`, which means the topic name.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: ${topic}
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 data.stream.timestamp.field



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: All documents sent to a data stream need an ``@timestamp`` field with values of type ``date`` or ``date_nanos``. Otherwise, the document  will not be sent. If multiple fields are provided, the first field listed that also appears in the record will be used. If this configuration is left empty, all of the documents will use the Kafka record timestamp as the ``@timestamp`` field value. Note that ``@timestamp`` still needs to be explicitly listed if records already contain this field.
	 - Required: LOW

==========================
Additional Configs
==========================
🔘 value.converter.replace.null.with.default

Whether to replace fields that have a default value and that are null to the default value. When set to true, the default value is used, otherwise null is used. Applicable for JSON Converter.

🔘 errors.tolerance

Use this property if you would like to configure the connector's error handling behavior. WARNING: This property should be used with CAUTION for SOURCE CONNECTORS as it may lead to dataloss. If you set this property to 'all', the connector will not fail on errant records, but will instead log them (and send to DLQ for Sink Connectors) and continue processing. If you set this property to 'none', the connector task will fail on errant records.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: all
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false
