all:
  vars:
    ansible_connection: docker
    ansible_user: root
    ansible_become: true
    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /tmp/certs/ssh_priv.pem

    #### Setting Proxy Environment variables ####
    ## To set proxy env vars for the duration of playbook run, uncomment below block and set as necessary
    # proxy_env:
    #   http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080
    #   https_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080
    #   no_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080

    #### SASL Authentication Configuration ####
    ## By default there will be no SASL Authentication
    ## For SASL/PLAIN uncomment this line:
    sasl_protocol: plain
    ## For SASL/SCRAM uncomment this line:
    # sasl_protocol: scram
    ## For SASL/GSSAPI uncomment this line and see Kerberos Configuration properties below
    # sasl_protocol: kerberos

    #### Kerberos Configuration ####
    ## Applicable when sasl_protocol is kerberos
    # kerberos_kafka_broker_primary: <Name of the primary set on the kafka brokers' principal eg. kafka>
    ## REQUIRED: Under each host set keytab file path and principal name, see below
    # kerberos_configure: <Boolean for ansible to install kerberos packages and configure this file: /etc/krb5.conf, defaults to true>
    # kerberos:
    #   realm: <KDC server realm eg. confluent.example.com>
    #   kdc_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>
    #   admin_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>

    #### TLS Configuration ####
    ## By default, data will NOT be encrypted. To turn on TLS encryption, uncomment this line
    ssl_enabled: true
    ## By default, the components will be configured with One-Way TLS, to turn on TLS mutual auth, uncomment this line:
    # ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    ## By default, the certs for this configuration will be self signed, to deploy custom certificates there are two options.
    ## Option 1: Custom Certs
    ## You will need to provide the path to the Certificate Authority Cert used to sign each hosts' certs
    ## As well as the signed certificate path and the key for that certificate for each host.
    ## These will need to be set for the correct host
    # ssl_custom_certs: true
    # ssl_ca_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/ca.crt"
    # ssl_signed_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-signed.crt"
    # ssl_key_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-key.pem"
    # ssl_key_password: <password for key for each host, will be inputting in the form -passin pass:{{ssl_key_password}} >
    ## Option 2: Custom Keystores and Truststores
    ## CP-Ansible can move keystores/truststores to their corresponding hosts and configure the components to use them. Set These vars
    # ssl_provided_keystore_and_truststore: true
    # ssl_keystore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-keystore.jks"
    # ssl_keystore_key_password: mystorepassword
    # ssl_keystore_store_password: mystorepassword
    # ssl_truststore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/truststore.jks"
    # ssl_truststore_password: truststorepass

    #### Certificate Regeneration ####
    ## When using self signed certificates, each playbook run will regenerate the CA, to turn this off, uncomment this line:
    # regenerate_ca: false
    ## By default, if keystore/truststore files exists for a component, the playbook will not recreate them
    ## To recreate the keystores and truststores uncomment this line:
    # regenerate_keystore_and_truststore: true

    #### Monitoring Configuration ####
    ## Jolokia is enabled by default. The Jolokia jar gets pulled from the internet and enabled on all the components
    ## To disable, uncomment this line:
    # jolokia_enabled: false
    ## During setup, the hosts will download the jolokia agent jar from Maven. To update that jar download set this var
    # jolokia_jar_url: http://<inteneral-server>/jolokia-jvm-1.6.2-agent.jar
    ## JMX Exporter is disabled by default. When enabled, JMX Exporter jar will be pulled from the Internet and enabled on the broker *only*.
    ## To enable, uncomment this line:
    # jmxexporter_enabled: true
    ## To update that jar download set this var
    # jmxexporter_jar_url: http://<internal-server>/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.12.0.jar

    #### Custom Yum Repo File (Rhel/Centos) ####
    ## If you are using your own yum repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # custom_yum_repofile: true
    # custom_yum_repofile_filepath: /tmp/my-repo.repo

    #### Custom Apt Repo File (Ubuntu/Debian) ####
    ## If you are using your own apt repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # custom_apt_repo: true
    # custom_apt_repo_filepath: "/tmp/my-source.list"

    #### Confluent Server vs Confluent Kafka ####
    ## Confluent Server will be installed by default, to install confluent-kafka instead, uncomment the below
    # confluent_server_enabled: false

    #### Schema Validation ####
    ## Schema Validation with the kafka configuration is disabled by default. To enable uncomment this line:
    ## Schema Validation only works with confluent_server_enabled: true
    # kafka_broker_schema_validation_enabled: true

    #### Fips Security ####
    ## To enable Fips for added security, uncomment the below line.
    ## Fips only works with ssl_enabled: true and confluent_server_enabled: true
    # fips_enabled: true

    #### Configuring Different Security on both Listeners ####
    ## CP-Ansible will configure two listeners on the broker: an internal listener for the broker to communicate and an external for the components and other clients.
    ## If you only need one listener uncomment this line:
    # kafka_broker_configure_additional_brokers: false
    ## By default both of these listeners will follow whatever you set for ssl_enabled and sasl_protocol.
    ## To configure different security settings on the internal and external listeners set the following variables:
    # kafka_broker_custom_listeners:
    #   internal:
    #     name: INTERNAL
    #     port: 9091
    #     ssl_enabled: false
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: none
    #   external:
    #     name: EXTERNAL
    #     port: 9092
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: scram
    ## You can even add additional listeners, make sure all variables are set
    #   client_listener:
    #     name: CLIENT
    #     port: 9093
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    #     sasl_protocol: scram

    #### Creating Connectors ####
    ## To manage the connector configs from Ansible, set the following list of connector objects:
    ## one per connector, must have `name` and `config` properties
    ## make sure to provide the numeric values as strings
    # kafka_connect_connectors:
    #   - name: sample-connector
    #     config:
    #       connector.class: "FileStreamSinkConnector"
    #       tasks.max: "1"
    #       file: "path/to/file.txt"
    #       topics: "test_topic"

    ## To set custom properties for each service
    ## Find property options in the Confluent Documentation
    # zookeeper:
    #   properties:
    #     initLimit: 6

      zookeeper_id: 1
      ## By default the first host will get zookeeper id=1, second gets id=2. Set zookeeper_id to customize
      # zookeeper_id: 2

      ## For kerberos sasl protocol, EACH host will need these two variables:
      # zookeeper_kerberos_keytab_path: <The path on ansible host to keytab file, eg. /tmp/keytabs/zookeeper-ip-172-31-34-246.us-east-2.compute.internal.keytab>

kafka_broker:
  ## To apply variables specifically to the hosts within kafka_broker group, you can add a vars block like below
  # vars:
  #   ## To configure Kafka to run as a custom user, uncomment below
  #   kafka_broker_user: custom-user
  #   kafka_broker_group: custom-group
  #   # To update the log.dirs property within the kafka server.properties, uncomment below

  hosts:
      ## By default the first host will get broker id=1, second gets id=2. Set broker_id to customize
      # broker_id: 3

      ## Properties can also be applied on a host by host basis.
      ## In the below example we configure a Multi-Region Clusters by setting the following properties on each host:
      # kafka_broker:
      #   properties:
      #     broker.rack: us-east-1d
      #     replica.selector.class: org.apache.kafka.common.replica.RackAwareReplicaSelector
