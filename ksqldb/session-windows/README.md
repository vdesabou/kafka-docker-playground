# How to create session windows

## Objective

See how we can group a time series of events into variable-size, non-overlapping time intervals based on a configurable inactivity period

## How to run

Simply run:

```
$ playground run -f start<use tab key to activate [fzf completion](https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/cli?id=%e2%9a%a1-setup-completion) (otherwise use full path, i.e *not relative path*>
```
