	 - Default: DISABLED
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 topic.to.external.resource.mapping



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: A list of topic-to-resource mappings in the format 'topic:resource'. If specified, the connector will use the provided resource name (index, data stream, or alias) instead of the topic name for writing to Elasticsearch. The resource must exist in Elasticsearch before configuring the connector. The type of resource (index, data stream, or alias) is determined by the 'external.resource.usage' configuration.
	 - Required: HIGH

🔘 max.external.resource.mappings

The maximum number of topic-to-external-resource mappings allowed.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 15
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 data.stream.type

Generic type describing the data to be written to data stream. The default is NONE which indicates the connector will write to regular indices instead. If set, this configuration will be used alongside data.stream.dataset and data.stream.namespace to construct the data stream name in the form of {``data.stream.type``}-{``data.stream.dataset``}-{``data.stream.namespace``}. Custom index templates defined in the destination cluster are supported.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: NONE
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 data.stream.dataset



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Generic name describing data ingested and its structure to be written to a data stream. Can be any arbitrary string that is no longer than 100 characters, is in all lowercase, and does not contain spaces or any of these special characters ``/\*"<>|,#:-``. Otherwise, no value indicates the connector will write to regular indices instead. If set, this configuration will be used alongside ``data.stream.type`` and ``data.stream.namespace`` to construct the data stream name in the form of {``data.stream.type``}-{``data.stream.dataset``}-{``data.stream.namespace``}.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 data.stream.namespace

Generic name describing user-configurable arbitrary grouping to be written to a data stream. Can be any arbitrary string that is no longer than 100 characters,  is in all lowercase, and does not contain spaces or any of these special characters ``/\*"<>|,#:-``. Otherwise, no value indicates the connector will write to regular indices instead. If set, this configuration will be used alongside ``data.stream.type`` and ``data.stream.dataset`` to construct the data stream name inthe form of {``data.stream.type``}-{``data.stream.dataset``}-{``data.stream.namespace``}. Defaut value is ``${topic}``, that is to say the topic name.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: ${topic}
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 data.stream.timestamp.field

 All documents sent to a data stream needs an ``@timestamp`` field with values of type ``date`` or ``data_nanos``. Otherwise, the document will not be sent. If multiple fields are provided, the first field listed that also appears in the record will be used. If this configuration is left empty, all of the documents will use the Kafka record timestamp as the ``@timestamp`` field value. Note that ``@timestamp`` still needs to be explicitly listed if records already contain this field. This configuration can only be set if ``data.stream.type`` and ``data.stream.dataset`` are set.

	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: The Kafka record field to use as the timestamp for the ``@timestamp`` field in documents sent to a data stream.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 batch.size

The number of records to process as a batch when writing to Elasticsearch.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 2000
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 bulk.size.bytes

The maximum size (in bytes) to be process as a batch when writing records to Elasticsearch. Setting to '-1' will disable this configuration. If the condition set by 'batch.size' is met first, it will be used instead.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 20000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 linger.ms

Linger time in milliseconds for batching.

	 - Type: LONG
	 - Default: 1
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

	 - Type: LONG
	 - Default: 180000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 flush.synchronously

True if flushes should wait for background processing to finish. This has a throughput penalty and makes the connector less responsive but allows for topic-mutating SMTs (e.g. RegexRouter or TimestampRouter)

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 max.retries

The maximum number of retries that are allowed for failed indexing requests. If the retry attempts are exhausted the task will fail.

	 - Default: 5
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 retry.backoff.ms

How long to wait in milliseconds before attempting the first retry of a failed indexing request. Upon a failure, this connector may wait up to twice as long as the previous wait, up to the maximum number of retries. This avoids retrying in a tight loop under failure scenarios.

	 - Default: 100
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 connection.compression

Whether to use GZip compression on HTTP connection to ElasticSearch. Valid options are ``true`` and ``false``. Default is ``false``. To make this setting to work the ``http.compression`` setting also needs to be enabled at the Elasticsearch nodes or the load-balancer before using it.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 max.connection.idle.time.ms

How long to wait in milliseconds before dropping an idle connection to prevent a read timeout.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 60000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 connection.timeout.ms

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 1000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 read.timeout.ms

How long to wait in milliseconds for the Elasticsearch server to send a response. The task fails if any read operation times out, and will need to be restarted to resume further operations.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 3000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
Data Conversion
==========================
🔘 key.ignore

Whether to ignore the record key for the purpose of forming the Elasticsearch document ID. When this is set to ``true``, document IDs will be generated as the record's ``topic+partition+offset``.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 schema.ignore

Whether to ignore schemas during indexing. When this is set to ``true``, the record schema will be ignored for the purpose of registering an Elasticsearch mapping. Elasticsearch will infer the mapping from the data (dynamic mapping needs to be enabled by the user).

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 compact.map.entries

Defines how map entries with string keys within record values should be written to JSON. When this is set to ``true``, these entries are written compactly as ``"entryKey": "entryValue"``. Otherwise, map entries with string keys are written as a nested document ``{"key": "entryKey", "value": "entryValue"}``. All map entries with non-string keys are always written as nested documents. Prior to 3.3.0, this connector always wrote map entries as nested documents, so set this to ``false`` to use that older behavior.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: true
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 topic.key.ignore



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: List of topics for which ``key.ignore`` should be ``true``.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 topic.schema.ignore



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: LIST
	 - Importance: List of topics for which ``schema.ignore`` should be ``true``.

	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 behavior.on.null.values

How to handle records with a non-null key and a null value (i.e. Kafka tombstone records). Valid options are 'ignore', 'delete', and 'fail'.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: FAIL
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 behavior.on.malformed.documents

How to handle records that Elasticsearch rejects due to some malformation of the document itself, such as an index mapping conflict, a field name containing illegal characters, or a record with a missing id. Valid options are ignore', 'warn', and 'fail'.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: FAIL
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 external.version.header



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: Header name to pull value for external versioning, defaults to using the kafka record offset.  Must have a numeric value.
	 - Required: LOW

🔘 write.method

Method used for writing data to Elasticsearch, and one of INSERT or UPSERT. The default method is INSERT, in which the connector constructs a document from the record value and inserts that document into Elasticsearch, completely replacing any existing document with the same ID; this matches previous behavior. The UPSERT method will create a new document if one with the specified ID does not yet exist, or will update an existing document with the same ID by adding/replacing only those fields present in the record value. The UPSERT method may require additional time and resources of Elasticsearch, so consider increasing the read.timeout.ms and decreasing the batch.size configuration properties.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: INSERT
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
Connector
==========================
🔘 use.autogenerated.ids

Whether to use auto-generated Elasticsearch document IDs for insertion requests. Note that this setting removes exactly once guarantees and message delivery will be at least once. Only applies if write.method is set to INSERT.When this is set to ``true``, ``key.ignore`` option will also be ignored when sending data to Elasticsearch

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.key.password

The password of the private key in the key store file or the PEM key specified in 'ssl.keystore.key'.

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH

	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.keystore.password

The store password for the key store file. This is optional for client and only needed if 'ssl.keystore.location' is configured. Key store password is not supported for PEM format.

The location of the trust store file.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.truststore.password

The password for the trust store file. If a password is not set, trust store file configured will still be used, but integrity checking is disabled. Trust store password is not supported for PEM format.

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.enabled.protocols

The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections. The default is 'TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3'. This means that clients and servers will prefer TLSv1.3 if both support it and fallback to TLSv1.2 otherwise (assuming both support at least TLSv1.2). This default should be fine for most use cases. Also see the config documentation for `ssl.protocol` to understand how it can impact the TLS version negotiation behavior.

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.keystore.type

The file format of the key store file. This is optional for client. The values currently supported by the default `ssl.engine.factory.class` are [JKS, PKCS12, PEM].

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: JKS
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.protocol

The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. The default is 'TLSv1.3', which should be fine for most use cases. A typical alternative to the default is 'TLSv1.2'. Allowed values for this config are dependent on the JVM. Clients using the defaults for this config and 'ssl.enabled.protocols' will downgrade to 'TLSv1.2' if the server does not support 'TLSv1.3'. If this config is set to 'TLSv1.2', however, clients will not use 'TLSv1.3' even if it is one of the values in `ssl.enabled.protocols` and the server only supports 'TLSv1.3'.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: TLSv1.3
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.provider

The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm

The endpoint identification algorithm to validate server hostname using server certificate. 

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: https
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.engine.factory.class

The class of type org.apache.kafka.common.security.auth.SslEngineFactory to provide SSLEngine objects. Default value is org.apache.kafka.common.security.ssl.DefaultSslEngineFactory. Alternatively, setting this to org.apache.kafka.common.security.ssl.CommonNameLoggingSslEngineFactory will log the common name of expired SSL certificates used by clients to authenticate at any of the brokers with log level INFO. Note that this will cause a tiny delay during establishment of new connections from mTLS clients to brokers due to the extra code for examining the certificate chain provided by the client. Note further that the implementation uses a custom truststore based on the standard Java truststore and thus might be considered a security risk due to not being as mature as the standard one.

	 - Type: CLASS
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 elastic.https.ssl.keymanager.algorithm

The algorithm used by key manager factory for SSL connections. Default value is the key manager factory algorithm configured for the Java Virtual Machine.
