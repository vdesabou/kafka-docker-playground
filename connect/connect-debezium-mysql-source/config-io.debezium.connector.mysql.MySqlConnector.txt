After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the binlog.; 'schema_only_recovery': The connector performs a snapshot that captures only the database schema history. The connector then transitions back to streaming. Use this setting to restore a corrupted or lost database schema history topic. Do not use if the database schema was modified after the connector stopped.; 'initial' (default): If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the binlog.; 'initial_only': The connector performs a snapshot as it does for the 'initial' option, but after the connector completes the snapshot, it stops, and does not stream changes from the binlog.; 'never': The connector does not run a snapshot. Upon first startup, the connector immediately begins reading from the beginning of the binlog. The 'never' mode should be used with care, and only when the binlog is known to contain all history.

🔘 bigint.unsigned.handling.mode

Specify how BIGINT UNSIGNED columns should be represented in change events, including: 'precise' uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'long' (the default) represents values using Java's 'long', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: long
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 time.precision.mode

Time, date and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including: 'adaptive_time_microseconds': the precision of date and timestamp values is based the database column's precision; but time fields always use microseconds precision; 'connect': always represents time, date and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: adaptive_time_microseconds

	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 min.row.count.to.stream.results

	 - Default: 1024
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 incremental.snapshot.allow.schema.changes

Detect schema change during an incremental snapshot and re-select a current chunk to avoid locking DDLs. Note that changes to a primary key are not supported and can cause incorrect results if performed during an incremental snapshot. Another limitation is that if a schema change affects only columns' default values, then the change won't be detected until the DDL is processed from the binlog stream. This doesn't affect the snapshot events' values, but the schema of snapshot events may have outdated defaults.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 snapshot.locking.mode

Controls how long the connector holds onto the global read lock while it is performing a snapshot. The default is 'minimal', which means the connector holds the global read lock (and thus prevents any updates) for just the initial portion of the snapshot while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this can be done using the snapshot process' REPEATABLE READ transaction even when the lock is no longer held and other operations are updating the database. However, in some cases it may be desirable to block all writes for the entire duration of the snapshot; in such cases set this property to 'extended'. Using a value of 'none' will prevent the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot process. This mode can only be used in combination with snapshot.mode values of 'schema_only' or 'schema_only_recovery' and is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: minimal
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

A comma-separated list of regular expressions matching fully-qualified names of columns that adds the column’s original type and original length as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records.

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 datatype.propagate.source.type

A comma-separated list of regular expressions matching the database-specific data type names that adds the data type's original type and original length as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records.

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 internal.snapshot.scan.all.columns.force

Restore pre 1.5 behaviour and scan all tables to discover columns. If you are excluding one table then turning this on may improve performance. If you are excluding a lot of tables the default behavior should work well.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 snapshot.tables.order.by.row.count

Controls the order in which tables are processed in the initial snapshot. A `descending` value will order the tables by row count descending. A `ascending` value will order the tables by row count ascending. A value of `disabled` (the default) will disable ordering by row count.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: disabled
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 heartbeat.action.query

The query executed with every heartbeat.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 include.query

Whether the connector should include the original SQL query that generated the change event. Note: This option requires the database to be configured using the server option binlog_rows_query_log_events (MySQL) or binlog_annotate_row_events (MariaDB) set to ON.Query will not be present for events generated from snapshot. WARNING: Enabling this option may expose tables or fields explicitly excluded or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event. For this reason the default value is 'false'.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 table.ignore.builtin

Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: true
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 database.include.list

The databases for which changes are to be captured

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 database.exclude.list

A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match database names to be excluded from monitoring

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 binlog.buffer.size

The size of a look-ahead buffer used by the binlog reader to decide whether the transaction in progress is going to be committed or rolled back. Use 0 to disable look-ahead buffering. Defaults to 0 (i.e. buffering is disabled.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 0
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 event.deserialization.failure.handling.mode

Specify how failures during deserialization of binlog events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled, including: 'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped; 'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: fail
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 inconsistent.schema.handling.mode

Specify how binlog events that belong to a table missing from internal schema representation (i.e. internal representation is not consistent with database) should be handled, including: 'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped; 'skip' the problematic event will be skipped.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: fail
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 gtid.source.filter.dml.events

When set to true, only produce DML events for transactions that were written on the server with matching GTIDs defined by the `gtid.source.includes` or `gtid.source.excludes`, if they were specified.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: true
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 gtid.source.includes

The source UUIDs used to include GTID ranges when determine the starting position in the MySQL server's binlog.

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 gtid.source.excludes

The source UUIDs used to exclude GTID ranges when determine the starting position in the MySQL server's binlog.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 sourceinfo.struct.maker

The name of the SourceInfoStructMaker class that returns SourceInfo schema and struct.

	 - Type: CLASS
	 - Default: io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlSourceInfoStructMaker
