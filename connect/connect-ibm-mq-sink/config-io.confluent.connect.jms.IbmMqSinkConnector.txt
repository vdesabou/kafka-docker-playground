==========================
IBM MQ Connection
==========================
🔘 mq.hostname



	 - Type: false

When configured, the connector will attempt to connect to each instance in sequence until a successful connection is established. This property is mutually exclusive with mq.hostname. Either mq.hostname or mq.connection.list must be specified, but not both.

==========================
Exactly Once Delivery
==========================
🔘 exactly.once.enabled

Enables exactly-once delivery semantics by using transacted JMS sessions and storing Kafka offsets in a dedicated IBM MQ queue. When enabled, the connector will write messages and offsets in the same transaction, ensuring exactly-once delivery guarantees. When disabled (default), the connector uses CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode for legacy at-least-once delivery. Requires ``mq.offsets.queue.name`` to be configured.

	 - Required: false

🔘 mq.offsets.queue.name



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING

	 - Required: MEDIUM

🔘 max.offset.sync.failures

Maximum number of successive offset synchronization failures allowed before the connector fails. This applies when exactly-once delivery is enabled and the task attempts to synchronize offsets from the MQ offsets queue after a rebalance. If synchronization fails this many times consecutively, the connector will throw an exception and stop.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 5
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

==========================
IBM MQ Secure Connection
==========================
🔘 mq.tls.protocol

The TLS protocol version for secure connections to IBM MQ. The default is ``TLSv1.2``, which should be fine for most cases, though the actual set of allowed values will depend on the JVM. Recent JVMs support ``TLSv1.3`` and ``TLSv1.2``, ``TLSv1.1`` and ``TLS``. Older JVMs may support ``SSL``, ``SSLv2`` and ``SSLv3``, but these versions are discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities.

	 - Type: STRING

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 jms.forward.kafka.metadata

If enabled, metadata from the |ak| record is forwarded on the JMS Message properties. This includes the record's topic, partition, and offset. The topic name is applied as a String property named ``KAFKA_TOPIC``, the partition value is applied as an Int property named ``KAFKA_PARTITION``, and the offset value is applied as a Long property named ``KAFKA_OFFSET``.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 150
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 jms.connection.backoff.ms

Following a connection failure, this configuration parameter is the amount of time in milliseconds to wait before attempting to reconnect to the JMS broker. A value less than or equal to 0 removes the delay altogether.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 2000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
JMS Formatter
==========================
🔘 jms.message.format

The format of the values on the JMS messages.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: string
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

==========================
JSON Formatter
==========================
🔘 jms.message.format.schemas.cache.size

The maximum number of schemas that can be cached in the JSON formatter.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 128
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 jms.message.format.schemas.enable

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

==========================
JMS Formatter
==========================
🔘 character.encoding

The character encoding to use while writing the message.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: UTF-8
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
JMS MessageProducer
==========================
🔘 jms.producer.time.to.live.ms

Time to live (TTL) in milliseconds for messages sent to the JMS broker.

	 - Type: LONG
	 - Default: 0
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 jms.producer.delivery.mode

The ``PERSISTENT`` delivery mode (the default) instructs the JMS provider to take extra care to ensure that a message is not lost in transit in case of a JMS provider failure. The ``NON_PERSISTENT`` delivery mode does not require the JMS provider to store the message or otherwise guarantee that it is not lost if the provider fails. Connectors using the ``PERSISTENT`` delivery mode have lower overall throughput than those running with ``NON_PERSISTENT`` delivery mode. However, the ``NON_PERSISTENT`` delivery mode does not offer the same delivery guarantees as the ``PERSISTENT`` delivery mode.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: persistent
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 jms.producer.disable.message.id

Sets whether message IDs are disabled. Since message IDs take some effort to create and increase a message's size, some JMS providers may be able to optimize message overhead if they are given a hint that the message ID is not used by an application. JMS message Producers provide a hint to disable message ID. When a connector sets a Producer to disable message ID, the connector is indicating that it does not depend on the value of message ID for the messages it produces. These messages must either have the message ID set to null or, if the hint is ignored, the message ID must be set to its normal unique value. Message IDs are enabled by default.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 jms.producer.disable.message.timestamp

Sets whether message timestamps are disabled. Since timestamps take some effort to create and increase a message's size, some JMS providers may be able to optimize message overhead, if they are given a hint that the timestamp is not used by an application. JMS message Producers provide a hint to disable timestamps. When a connector sets a Producer to disable timestamps, the connector is indicating that it does not depend on the value of timestamp for the messages it produces. These messages must either have the timestamp set to null or, if the hint is ignored, the timestamp must be set to its normal value. Message timestamps are enabled by default.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false
