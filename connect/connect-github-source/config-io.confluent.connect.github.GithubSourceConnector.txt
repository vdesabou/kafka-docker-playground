This list should be in the form ``host1:port1,host2:port2,...``. These servers are used only for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership, which may change dynamically, so this list need not contain the full set of servers. You may want more than one, in case a server is down.

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: true

==========================
SSL
==========================
🔘 https.ssl.enabled

Whether or not to connect to the endpoint via SSL.

	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.protocol

The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. The default is 'TLSv1.3', which should be fine for most use cases. A typical alternative to the default is 'TLSv1.2'. Allowed values for this config are dependent on the JVM. Clients using the defaults for this config and 'ssl.enabled.protocols' will downgrade to 'TLSv1.2' if the server does not support 'TLSv1.3'. If this config is set to 'TLSv1.2', however, clients will not use 'TLSv1.3' even if it is one of the values in `ssl.enabled.protocols` and the server only supports 'TLSv1.3'.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: TLSv1.3
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.provider

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.enabled.protocols

The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections. The default is 'TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3'. This means that clients and servers will prefer TLSv1.3 if both support it and fallback to TLSv1.2 otherwise (assuming both support at least TLSv1.2). This default should be fine for most use cases. Also see the config documentation for `ssl.protocol` to understand how it can impact the TLS version negotiation behavior.

	 - Type: LIST
	 - Default: TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.key.password

The password of the private key in the key store file or the PEM key specified in 'ssl.keystore.key'.

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.keystore.key

Private key in the format specified by 'ssl.keystore.type'. Default SSL engine factory supports only PEM format with PKCS#8 keys. If the key is encrypted, key password must be specified using 'ssl.key.password'

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.keystore.certificate.chain

Certificate chain in the format specified by 'ssl.keystore.type'. Default SSL engine factory supports only PEM format with a list of X.509 certificates

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.truststore.certificates

Trusted certificates in the format specified by 'ssl.truststore.type'. Default SSL engine factory supports only PEM format with X.509 certificates.

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.truststore.type

The file format of the trust store file. The values currently supported by the default `ssl.engine.factory.class` are [JKS, PKCS12, PEM].

	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.truststore.location

The location of the trust store file.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.truststore.password

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.keymanager.algorithm

🔘 https.ssl.secure.random.implementation

The SecureRandom PRNG implementation to use for SSL cryptography operations.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

🔘 https.ssl.engine.factory.class

The class of type org.apache.kafka.common.security.auth.SslEngineFactory to provide SSLEngine objects. Default value is org.apache.kafka.common.security.ssl.DefaultSslEngineFactory. Alternatively, setting this to org.apache.kafka.common.security.ssl.CommonNameLoggingSslEngineFactory will log the common name of expired SSL certificates used by clients to authenticate at any of the brokers with log level INFO. Note that this will cause a tiny delay during establishment of new connections from mTLS clients to brokers due to the extra code for examining the certificate chain provided by the client. Note further that the implementation uses a custom truststore based on the standard Java truststore and thus might be considered a security risk due to not being as mature as the standard one.

	 - Type: CLASS
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false
