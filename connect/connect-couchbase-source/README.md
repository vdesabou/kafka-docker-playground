# Couchbase Source connector

![asciinema](https://github.com/vdesabou/gifs/blob/master/connect/connect-couchbase-source/asciinema.gif?raw=true)

## Objective

Quickly test [Couchbase Source](https://docs.couchbase.com/kafka-connector/3.4/index.html) connector.




## How to run

Simply run:

```
$ ./couchbase.sh
```

Note: if you want to test with a custom `couchbase.event.filter` class, use:

```
$ ./couchbase-with-key-filter.sh
```

It will filter using key starting with `airline`

Note: if you want to test with some [SMT](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/transforms/index.html) `ExtractTopic$Key` and `RegexRouter`, use:

```
$ ./couchbase-with-transforms.sh
```

The transforms are defined with:

```json
"transforms": "KeyExample,dropSufffix",
"transforms.KeyExample.type": "io.confluent.connect.transforms.ExtractTopic$Key",
"transforms.KeyExample.skip.missing.or.null": "true",
"transforms.dropSufffix.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.RegexRouter",
"transforms.dropSufffix.regex": "(.*)_.*",
"transforms.dropSufffix.replacement": "$1"
```

By using `ExtractTopic$Key`, the intermediate output topic will be the key, example `landmark_16320`or `airline_5268`
By then using `RegexRouter`defiined above, the final output topics will be `landmark`or `airline`

Couchbase UI is available at [127.0.0.1:8091](http://127.0.0.1:8091) `Administrator/password`

## Details of what the script is doing

Creating Couchbase cluster

```bash
$ docker exec couchbase bash -c "/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli cluster-init --cluster-username Administrator --cluster-password password --services=data,index,query"
```

Install Couchbase bucket example `travel-sample`

```bash
$ docker exec couchbase bash -c "/opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -c localhost:8091 -u Administrator -p password -b travel-sample -m 100 /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip"
```

Creating Couchbase Source connector

```bash
$ curl -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{

It looms precariously on it's two-star rating. The distraught condition of drug predators and illegals cramming their holed guts into the trickling walls probably purchased the minimal rating. To this corroded stature of suckitude, I may ask to command you a simple trot away, scorchingly applying pressure to the gas pedal. First off, the \\\"lobby\\\" is a tight and small space... just like the stairway/room/elevator. Our room had no form of heating in the brutal cold of Manhattan. The bathroom door did not lock, \\\"great\\\". The bed was FILTHY!! STAINS! STAINS! HAIR ON THE BED! My goodness... there is no standards for this dump.
